ZMQ_MSG_MORE(3)                                     0MQ Manual                                     ZMQ_MSG_MORE(3)

NAME
       zmq_msg_more - indicate if there are more message parts to receive

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_msg_more (zmq_msg_t *message);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_msg_more() function indicates whether this is part of a multi-part message, and there are further
       parts to receive. This method can safely be called after zmq_msg_close(). This method is identical to
       zmq_msg_get() with an argument of ZMQ_MORE.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_msg_more() function shall return zero if this is the final part of a multi-part message, or the
       only part of a single-part message. It shall return 1 if there are further parts to receive.

EXAMPLE
       Receiving a multi-part message.

           zmq_msg_t part;
           while (true) {
               //  Create an empty 0MQ message to hold the message part
               int rc = zmq_msg_init (&part);
               assert (rc == 0);
               //  Block until a message is available to be received from socket
               rc = zmq_msg_recv (socket, &part, 0);
               assert (rc != -1);
               if (zmq_msg_more (&part))
                   fprintf (stderr, "more\n");
               else {
                   fprintf (stderr, "end\n");
                   break;
               }
               zmq_msg_close (&part);
           }
