ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLIC(3)                                 0MQ Manual                                 ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLIC(3)

NAME
       zmq_curve_public - derive the public key from a private key

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_curve_public (char *z85_public_key, char *z85_secret_key);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_curve_public() function shall derive the public key from a private key. The caller provides two
       buffers, each at least 41 octets large. In z85_secret_key the caller shall provide the private key, and the
       function will store the public key in z85_public_key. The keys are encoded using zmq_z85_encode(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_curve_public() function shall return 0 if successful, else it shall return -1 and set errno to one
       of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       ENOTSUP
           The libzmq library was not built with cryptographic support (libsodium).

EXAMPLE
       Deriving the public key from a CURVE private key.

           char public_key [41];
           char secret_key [41];
           int rc = zmq_curve_keypair (public_key, secret_key);
           assert (rc == 0);
           char derived_public[41];
           rc = zmq_curve_public (derived_public, secret_key);
           assert (rc == 0);
           assert (!strcmp (derived_public, public_key));
