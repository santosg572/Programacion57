ZMQ_PLAIN(7)                                        0MQ Manual                                        ZMQ_PLAIN(7)

NAME
       zmq_plain - clear-text authentication

SYNOPSIS
       The PLAIN mechanism defines a simple username/password mechanism that lets a server authenticate a client.
       PLAIN makes no attempt at security or confidentiality. It is intended for use on internal networks where
       security requirements are low. The PLAIN mechanism is defined by this document:
       http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:24.

USAGE
       To use PLAIN, the server shall set the ZMQ_PLAIN_SERVER option, and the client shall set the
       ZMQ_PLAIN_USERNAME and ZMQ_PLAIN_PASSWORD socket options. Which peer binds, and which connects, is not
       relevant.
