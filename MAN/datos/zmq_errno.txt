ZMQ_ERRNO(3)                                        0MQ Manual                                        ZMQ_ERRNO(3)

NAME
       zmq_errno - retrieve value of errno for the calling thread

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_errno (void);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_errno() function shall retrieve the value of the errno variable for the calling thread.

       The zmq_errno() function is provided to assist users on non-POSIX systems who are experiencing issues with
       retrieving the correct value of errno directly. Specifically, users on Win32 systems whose application is
       using a different C run-time library from the C run-time library in use by 0MQ will need to use zmq_errno()
       for correct operation.

           Important
           Users not experiencing issues with retrieving the correct value of errno should not use this function
           and should instead access the errno variable directly.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_errno() function shall return the value of the errno variable for the calling thread.

ERRORS
       No errors are defined.
