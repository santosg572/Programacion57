ZMQ_CTX_SHUTDOWN(3)                                 0MQ Manual                                 ZMQ_CTX_SHUTDOWN(3)

NAME
       zmq_ctx_shutdown - shutdown a 0MQ context

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_ctx_shutdown (void *context);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_ctx_shutdown() function shall shutdown the 0MQ context context.

       Context shutdown will cause any blocking operations currently in progress on sockets open within context to
       return immediately with an error code of ETERM. With the exception of zmq_close(), any further operations
       on sockets open within context shall fail with an error code of ETERM. No further sockets can be created
       using zmq_socket() on a context for which zmq_ctx_shutdown() has been called, it will return and set errno
       to ETERM.

       This function is optional, client code is still required to call the zmq_ctx_term(3) function to free all
       resources allocated by zeromq.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_ctx_shutdown() function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno
       to one of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       EFAULT
           The provided context was invalid.
