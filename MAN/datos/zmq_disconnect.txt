ZMQ_DISCONNECT(3)                                   0MQ Manual                                   ZMQ_DISCONNECT(3)

NAME
       zmq_disconnect - Disconnect a socket from an endpoint

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_disconnect (void *socket, const char *endpoint);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_disconnect() function shall disconnect a socket specified by the socket argument from the endpoint
       specified by the endpoint argument. Note the actual disconnect system call might occur at a later time.

       Upon disconnection the will also stop receiving messages originating from this endpoint. Moreover, the
       socket will no longer be able to queue outgoing messages to this endpoint. The outgoing message queue
       associated with the endpoint will be discarded. However, if the socketâ€™s linger period is non-zero, libzmq
       will still attempt to transmit these discarded messages, until the linger period expires.

       The endpoint argument is as described in zmq_connect(3)

           Note
           The default setting of ZMQ_LINGER does not discard unsent messages; this behaviour may cause the
           application to block when calling zmq_ctx_term(). For details refer to zmq_setsockopt(3) and
           zmq_ctx_term(3).

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_disconnect() function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno
       to one of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       EINVAL
           The endpoint supplied is invalid.

       ETERM
           The 0MQ context associated with the specified socket was terminated.

       ENOTSOCK
           The provided socket was invalid.

       ENOENT
           The provided endpoint is not in use by the socket.

EXAMPLE
       Connecting a subscriber socket to an in-process and a TCP transport.

           /* Create a ZMQ_SUB socket */
           void *socket = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_SUB);
           assert (socket);
           /* Connect it to the host server001, port 5555 using a TCP transport */
           rc = zmq_connect (socket, "tcp://server001:5555");
           assert (rc == 0);
           /* Disconnect from the previously connected endpoint */
           rc = zmq_disconnect (socket, "tcp://server001:5555");
           assert (rc == 0);
