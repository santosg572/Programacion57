ZMQ_CLOSE(3)                                        0MQ Manual                                        ZMQ_CLOSE(3)

NAME
       zmq_close - close 0MQ socket

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_close (void *socket);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_close() function shall destroy the socket referenced by the socket argument. Any outstanding
       messages physically received from the network but not yet received by the application with zmq_recv() shall
       be discarded. The behaviour for discarding messages sent by the application with zmq_send() but not yet
       physically transferred to the network depends on the value of the ZMQ_LINGER socket option for the
       specified socket.

       zmq_close() must be called exactly once for each socket. If it is never called, zmq_ctx_term() will block
       forever. If it is called multiple times for the same socket or if socket does not point to a socket, the
       behaviour is undefined.

           Note
           The default setting of ZMQ_LINGER does not discard unsent messages; this behaviour may cause the
           application to block when calling zmq_ctx_term(). For details refer to zmq_setsockopt(3) and
           zmq_ctx_term(3).

           Note
           This API will complete asynchronously, so not everything will be deallocated after it returns. See
           above for details about linger.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_close() function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno to one
       of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       ENOTSOCK
           The provided socket was NULL.
