ZMQ_MSG_CLOSE(3)                                    0MQ Manual                                    ZMQ_MSG_CLOSE(3)

NAME
       zmq_msg_close - release 0MQ message

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_msg_close (zmq_msg_t *msg);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_msg_close() function shall inform the 0MQ infrastructure that any resources associated with the
       message object referenced by msg are no longer required and may be released. Actual release of resources
       associated with the message object shall be postponed by 0MQ until all users of the message or underlying
       data buffer have indicated it is no longer required.

       Applications should ensure that zmq_msg_close() is called once a message is no longer required, otherwise
       memory leaks may occur. Note that this is NOT necessary after a successful zmq_msg_send().

           Caution
           Never access zmq_msg_t members directly, instead always use the zmq_msg family of functions.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_msg_close() function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno to
       one of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       EFAULT
           Invalid message.
